# Wine
This is the front page of Wine.com.br, made to tangibilize html5 css3 and javascript knowledge.
It was made using:
Stencil.js - to create web components
Sass - to pre process the css files
Gulp - to minify images and compile scss files
and the other basics stuff normaly used in front end creation.
